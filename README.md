API for constructing Convex Hull, Triangulation of polygons and Delaunay triangulation of point sets.

Constrained Delaunay Trinagulation

Left: Input Polygon, Center: Simple Triangulation, Right: Constrained Delaunay Triangulation

![Center shows triangulation of a Polygon. Image on right side is constrained delaunay triangulation of the same polygon](https://github.com/Shikhar-S/Computational-Geometry/blob/master/Screenshots/delaunay_man.jpeg)

The algorithm used for delaunay triangulation is Lawson's Edge flip algorithm.


Simple Trinagulation.

Left: Input polygon, Center: Polygon broken into Y-monotone pieces, Right: Simple triangulation of Y-Monotone Pieces.

Algorithm used for making y montone pieces is based on Sweep line.


Triangulation of Point Set.

Left: Point Set, Center: Convex Hull and break up into left and right halfs, Right: Triangulation of both halves.
